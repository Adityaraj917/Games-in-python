# Tic Tac Toe Game (Pygame)

A simple and interactive **Tic Tac Toe (X/O)** game built using **Python** and **Pygame**. This project demonstrates basic game development concepts such as event handling, mouse input, drawing graphics, and maintaining the game board state.

# Features

* ✔️ Classic 3×3 Tic Tac Toe grid
* ✔️ Mouse-click based gameplay
* ✔️ Automatic turn switching (X → O → X)
* ✔️ Clean and smooth Pygame UI
* ✔️ Beginner-friendly project structure

#Project Structure

```
tic-tac-toe/
│── game.py        # Main game script
│── README.md      # Project documentation
```

## 🚀 How to Run

# 1️⃣ Install Requirements

```
pip install pygame
```

# 2️⃣ Run the Game

```
python game.py
```

# How the Game Works

* A **3×3 matrix** stores the board moves.
* Mouse clicks determine the selected cell.
* Player symbols (X and O) are drawn dynamically.
* After each move, the turn switches automatically.

# Known Issues (Fix These Before Running)

* `run = false` → `run = False`
* `event.tpye` → `event.type`
* `board[row][col] == player` → `board[row][col] = player`

 # Future Enhancements

* Add win detection
* Add draw detection
* Add restart feature
* Add AI opponent
* Add sound and animations
